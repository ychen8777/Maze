# Maze generation and resolution in Java
  - Implemented GUI with Java Swing
  - Maze generationg using BFS
  - Maze solving demo using DFS, BFS, and Wall Follower methods
  - Player controllable with arrow keys from keyboard

#### When open map is "off", only area visited by the player is visible

#### In easy mode, the path starts at top left and ends at top right. For difficult mode, I added more randomness of where the player starts.
